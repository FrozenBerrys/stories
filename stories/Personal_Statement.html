                <p>The warm air of midsummer morning. I circled the same path, attuned to the laughter of the families who chose to spend their Monday at the local park, a humble space with few benches but the grass was soft and lively green and more than enough for everyone. This was my second week skateboarding, but I still felt lost. I felt a little better fantasizing about my new life as a skater girl, though.</p>
                <p>The breezy but humid air of midsummer night. I circled the same path again and again, facing the dark sky above me. The families were gone, all but a few loners who I assumed wanted a break from theirs. I observed one of them, a man about my step dad's age. To my surprise, he came up to me to give me tips on my ollie.</p>
                <p>We took a break on one of the benches and he told me about his life like an old friend. His career as a doctor was going very well, but he felt guilty for not always being there for his daughter, wishing he could understand her better. This was his last night in Mongolia for another 6 months before his flight to Seoul the next morning. He got separated from the love of his life a few years ago, but still loved her very much. I had nothing to say, but hung onto every word.</p>
                <p>He said he saw a fire in me when he saw me falling off and getting back up with my smile. I shrugged. In truth, I was smiling because I didn’t want people to know I was embarrassed. I told him that and he laughed. At some point he pegged me as the kind of person who prefers to cry alone. This guy was some sort of psychic. It made me wonder, maybe I do have a fire in me.</p>
                <p>I asked the psychic why people study Physics if they know they’ll probably never arrive at the truth they seek. He laughed and told me, “If you’re asking that, you’ve probably never done real physics”. The psychic went on about spirituality, and asked me what the air was made of. I matched his enthusiasm to say “only 21% oxygen right?”. His look of surprise made me happy that I remember useless details like these.</p>
                <p>I slept soundly when I got home. I woke up and cried to my parents for the first time in a while. I asked them if they were happy that they ended up with each other. They asked me what made me worry, and that was enough to comfort me. I hugged them and told them they were awesome before leaving.</p>
                <p>The warm air of midsummer morning. A group of teenage boys sweating bullets as they circle the stadium near the local park, preparing for the city marathon next week. I felt a sense of camaraderie with them as I crashed my ollies trying to keep up. Every time I got back up my smile felt bigger and bigger. I was a fiery skater girl, right here, right now.</p>
                <p>I didn’t stay out so late that day. I went inside, ready to get to work. Youtube videos, neon highlighters, and a thick lined notebook with my favorite Richard Feynman quote on the front page. Maybe the details feel useless because I’ve never done real physics. Maybe not, but it made enough sense for me to pick up my pen.</p>
                <p>I’d forgotten how much I loved nights like these where I let myself learn anything I wanted. That midsummer night I looked at the not-so-dark sky above me, wondering if the stranger in Seoul was already asleep. I hoped he knew how much his words meant to me.</p>
